However, this was a free time project I did next to my full time job and it\'s very time-consuming to try and keep the server clean from illegal and scammy sites. I\'ve spent 10 times more time on deleting accounts than I could find time to continue development. At this time I do not plan on continuing the hosting project, but this doesn\'t have to be the end. There are other hosting providers like <a href="http://hzwjmjimhr7bdmfv2doll4upibt5ojjmpo3pbp5ctwcg37n3hyk7qzid.onion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ablative Hosting</a>, <a href="http://q3lgwxinynjxkor6wghr6hrhlix7fquja3t25phbagqizkpju36fwdyd.onion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneHost</a>, <a href="http://dwebkjkovsjobzrb45dz6prnlifnapiyp2dba33vcmcsaikr2re4d5qd.onion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnionLand Hosting</a> or a clearnet proxy service <a href="https://clearnetonion.eu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clearnet Onion | Easy clearnet relay</a> and my project is <a href="https://github.com/DanWin/hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for download</a>, which should enable anyone willing to become the next darknet shared hosting provider to start where I left of.'); ?></p>
