General Information:

This is the source code of my website on [danwin1210.de](https://danwin1210.de)

Translation:
--------------------------

Translations are managed in [Weblate](https://weblate.danwin1210.de/projects/DanWin/main-website).
If you prefer manually submitting translations, the script `update-translations.sh` can be used to update the language template and translation files from source.
It will generate the file `locale/main-website.pot` which you can then use as basis to create a new language file in `YOUR_LANG_CODE/LC_MESSAGES/main-website.po` and edit it with a translation program, such as [Poedit](https://poedit.net/).
Once you are done, you can open a pull request, or [email me](mailto:daniel@danwin1210.de), to include the translation.
