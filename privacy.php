<p><?php echo _('The Internet pages of Daniel Winzen use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.'); ?></p>
<p><?php echo _('Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.'); ?></p>
<p><?php echo _('Through the use of cookies, Daniel Winzen can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.'); ?></p>
<p><?php echo _('By means of a cookie, the information and offers on my website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow me, as previously mentioned, to recognize my website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize my website. An example for the use of a cookie is when you log in to the mail client, the cookie assures that you stay logged in with your account until closing your browser or logging out.'); ?></p>
<p><?php echo _('This site makes only use of technically necessary session cookies and does not use any form of tracking cookies.'); ?></p>
<p><?php echo _('The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through my website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of my website may be entirely usable.'); ?></p>
<h2><?php echo _('4. Collection of general data and information'); ?></h2>
<p><?php echo _('The server of Daniel Winzen collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website or other provided services. This general data and information is stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches my website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site / email transmission, (6) sender and recipient of an email, and (7) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on my information technology systems.'); ?></p>
<p><?php echo _('When using these general data and information, Daniel Winzen does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of my website and services correctly, (2) optimize my services, (3) ensure the long-term viability of my information technology systems and website technology. Therefore, I may analyze anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of my services, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data I process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject for up to 48 hours and are then permanently deleted.'); ?></p>
<h2><?php echo _('5. Registration on my website'); ?></h2>
<p><?php echo _('The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data.

The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g. an email server that a data subject wants to email) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.'); ?></p>
<p><?php echo _('By registering on the website of the controller, date and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of my services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.'); ?></p>
<p><?php echo _('The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.

<p><?php echo _('The website of Daniel Winzen contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to me, as well as direct communication with me, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.'); ?></p>
<h2><?php echo _('7. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data'); ?></h2>

<p><?php echo _('If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by Daniel Winzen, they may at any time contact the controller. Daniel Winzen will arrange the restriction of the processing.'); ?></p>
<h3><?php echo _('f) Right to data portability'); ?></h3>
<p><?php echo _('Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning them, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.

If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary to provide services, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning my services. If I am subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.'); ?>
	<?php echo _('Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the above-mentioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by me or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).'); ?></p>
<h2><?php echo _('10. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party'); ?></h2>
<p><?php echo _('Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR my legitimate interest is to carry out my business in favor of the well-being of all my data subjects and myself.'); ?></p>
<h2><?php echo _('11. Period for which the personal data will be stored'); ?></h2>
